INGREDIENTS
For The Marinade:
2 large chicken breasts, or 3 smaller-medium sized
1½ cups buttermilk
¼ cup Franks Buffalo Sauce
½ Tbsp garlic salt
For The Dry Ingredients:
1½ cups all purpose flour
¼ tsp salt
½ tsp onion powder
Black pepper to taste
1 Tbsp herbs de Provence
1 tsp smoked paprika
12 mini slider buns
6 slices pepper jack cheese, halved
5 cups canola oil
INSTRUCTIONS
Thinly slice each chicken breast diagonally into 6 pieces, keeping each piece
roughly the same size.
Place the chicken pieces into a bowl. Add the buttermilk, Frank's sauce and
garlic salt and mix well making sure all the chicken has been coated.
Let the chicken marinade, covered for at least 4 hours or overnight in the
fridge.
In another bowl, combine the flour, salt, onion powder, pepper, herbs de
Provence and paprika.
Heat the canola oil in a pan deep enough to hold about 4-5 pieces of chicken
at a time, until it reaches 375 degrees F.
Take a piece of chicken from the marinade and carefully shake off any excess
buttermilk. Drop it into the flour mixture and shake it around, coating
completely with the flour.
Shake off any excess flour and gently drop it into the hot oil. Proceed with
another 2-3 pieces.
Cook for about 3 minutes each side, maintaining a steady temperature of 375
degrees.
Transfer the cooked chicken to a dish with paper towel to absorb any oil.
Season again with some sea salt. Place a piece of chicken onto a bun and top
with a half slice of cheese and some more buffalo sauce if required.
